# Principal-component-analysis
Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.


What is a real life example of PCA?
Some real-world applications of PCA are image processing, movie recommendation system, optimizing the power allocation in various communication channels. It is a feature extraction technique, so it contains the important variables and drops the least important variable.
